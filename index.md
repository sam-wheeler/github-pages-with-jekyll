# The Less I Know the Better

- Someone said they left together
- I went out the door to get her
- She was holding hands with <del>Trevor</del>
- Not the greatest feeling ever
- She said, "It's not now or never.
- You should try your luck with Heather."
- And I heard they slept together
- *Oh the less I know the better*
